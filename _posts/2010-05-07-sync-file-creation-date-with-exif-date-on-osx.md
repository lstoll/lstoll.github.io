title: Sync File Creation Date with EXIF Date on OS X

So I could order my images in the Finder and use Smart Folders based on the created date of the image, I hacked this together to update the file creation date to match the EXIF date. For Mac OS X only.

See <a href="http://gist.github.com/310413">http://gist.github.com/310413</a> for all the code.
