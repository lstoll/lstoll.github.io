Because tumblr doesn't let you change the default blog, I wanted to clear out the old original blog I had to re-use for this site. Which brought me to the other problem - tumblr provide no way to batch delete posts, and will over 1,000 items in there I wasn't going to sit around and delete each one by hand. So here's a quick script I wrote, I hope it's useful to someone.
