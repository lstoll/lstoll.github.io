title: Locale Errors on Ubuntu

p(meta). 7/8/2007 - Sydney, NSW, AU.

I set up a new Ubuntu XEN VM, and installed a few packages.. then started getting errors like this all over the place:

<pre><code>perl: warning: Setting locale failed.

perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:

LANGUAGE = (unset),

LC_ALL = (unset),

LANG = “en_AU.UTF-8″

are supported and installed on your system.

perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (”C”).

locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory

locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory

locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory</pre></code>



Seems that at some point all the entries get screwed up for setting locales. I ran sudo apt-get install language-pack-en-base , and then everything was fineso this ease is brought to all ruby frameworks.
