I tried installing VMware Server 1.0.3 onto OpenSuse 10.2, and came across an issue - It wouldnâ€™t let me log in as root (or anything), telling me that I had an invalid username or password. To get it working I had to use yast to install pam-modules-32bit, then edit /etc/vmware/pam.d/vmware-authd , and replace \%pamdir\% with /usr/lib/vmware/lib/libpam.so.0/security . You should then be right to go, straight away!
