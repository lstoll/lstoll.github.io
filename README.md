Personal site for Lincoln Stoll.

This site was lovingly designed by :two_hearts: @saltinejustine. It was built on [Zurb's Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) framework and runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.org).

###Run locally

To run it locally clone the repo and `cd` into it.

Within the repo run `$ bundle install` and then `$ jekyll serve --watch` to run a development server.
